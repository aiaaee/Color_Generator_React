The only hook that was used in this project was the useState hook so that we can use it to get the Horizontal, Vertical, Blur, as well as Color and Spread values, and finally by placing them in the value space of each of our Inputs, it leads to A color generator was built so that we can use it to get the box-shadow values ​​of each of our elements.
